# **BOBaFIT: Refitting diploid region profiles using a clustering procedure**

This is the repository of the code used in R package "BOBaFIT", published in Bioconductor Release (3.18). 

See BIOCONDUCTOR page for installation, documentation and details: https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BOBaFIT.html 



This package provides a method to refit and correct the diploid region in copy number profiles. It uses a clustering algorithm to identify pathology-specific normal (diploid) chromosomes and then use their copy number signal to refit the whole profile. 
The package is composed by three functions: DRrefit (the main function), ComputeNormalChromosome and PlotCluster.
